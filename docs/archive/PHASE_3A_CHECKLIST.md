# Phase 3A: Agency Workflow Implementation - Complete

## Workflow Components Built
- [x] WorkflowItem type with stages, velocity, blockers, dependencies
- [x] DecisionPoint type with options, rationale, impact tracking
- [x] Workflows listing page with stage and velocity filters
- [x] Workflow detail page with momentum tracking
- [x] Decision log integration
- [x] Dependencies tracking
- [x] Blocker alerts and visibility

## Behavioral Patterns Implemented
- [x] Velocity/momentum indicators (stalled, slow, steady, accelerating)
- [x] Decision audit trail with rationale and options explored
- [x] Dependency tracking with status visibility
- [x] Blocker management with alerts
- [x] Confidence levels for timeline predictions
- [x] Next milestone tracking

## Navigation Updates
- [x] Added Workflows to main navigation
- [x] Integrated with existing agency modules

## Quality Gates
- [x] All role-based tokens used (no raw hex)
- [x] Density/surface modes supported
- [x] RTL compatible layout
- [x] Keyboard accessible
- [x] Focus-visible states working

Phase 3A complete. Workflow management system demonstrates agency-specific behaviors: streams, feedback loops, decision tracking, and momentum indicators.
