Check for active epic ledgers and resume work:

1. Read all files in `/thoughts/ledgers/`
2. Find any ledger with Status: ACTIVE or IN_PROGRESS
3. Summarize:
   - Current phase and progress percentage
   - What was done in the last session
   - Next actions from the ledger
4. Ask if I should continue with the next action
